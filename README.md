# Media-Analysis
In this project, we analyze the media representation and coverage given to the migrant exodus between April'20 to April'21. To assess the relative coverage given to this issue, we scrape the top 10 headlines published by the Times of India every day within the mentioned one year. Further, we analyse the policy schemes mentioned in the articles and their frequency with the help of computational content analysis using natural language processing.

The data and the output files will be published with the paper shortly.
